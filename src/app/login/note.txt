data is shared by data binding 

METHODS in data binding?
1) one way binding
  1.1)component to view
         technique used is : 
        1.1.1)string interpolation: {{}}
        1.1.2)property binding: [property name]="value"

 1.2)view to component(important)
      1.2) technique used is:
            1.2.1) event binding: (event name)="methodname()"
            1.2.2) $event binding: (event name)="methodname($event)"
             here the event is considered as an object and it is accessed using event.target.value
            1.2.3) event binding using template reference variable : #variablename
       data can be easily accessed from the input using this method instead of event binding

2) two way binding
       2.1)  ngModel  -has FormsModule(a module in ngModel) a content in angular forms: [(ngModel)]="value"
its a method used instead of template refernce variable and its the simplest method.
